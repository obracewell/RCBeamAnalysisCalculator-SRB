When provided the given characteristics of a rectangular reinforced concrete beam section, this program will check if the cross-sectional area of the beam exceeds the maximum. Through running various calculations, it will then provide the height of the Whitney Stress Block (a), the distance to the neutral axis from the compression face (c), the steel strain at failure (Îµt), the maximum internal moment (Mn), and the design capacity moment. 

The characteristics necessary for calculation are the length of the base of the section, the depth of the reinforcing steel from the compression face, the cross-sectional area of the concrete, the compressive stress of concrete, and the yield stress of steel.
